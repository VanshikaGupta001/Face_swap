1. Load Source and Target Images

    Read the source face image and the target face image using OpenCV (cv2.imread()).

2. Detect Faces

    Use Mediapipe Face Detection to detect the bounding box of:

        Source face

        Target face

    If a face is not detected, exit the program.

3. Detect Key Facial Landmarks

    Use Mediapipe Face Mesh to detect detailed facial landmarks for:

        Source image

        Target image

    Select only 3 important landmarks:

        Left Eye (landmark #33)

        Right Eye (landmark #263)

        Nose Tip (landmark #1)

(These 3 points are enough to define the pose/angle of the face!)
4. Crop the Source Face

    Crop the source face using the bounding box.

    Adjust the landmark coordinates because after cropping, the landmark positions shift.

5. Calculate Affine Transformation Matrix

    Use cv2.getAffineTransform() to calculate the affine matrix that maps:

        Source 3 points âž” Target 3 points

(This matrix helps align the source face to match the pose, angle, and scale of the target face.)
6. Warp Source Face

    Apply the affine transformation on the cropped source face using cv2.warpAffine().

    Now the source face will fit the pose and size of the target face area.

7. Create a Mask for Seamless Cloning

    Create a white mask (all 255) only over the target bounding box area.

    This mask tells OpenCV where to blend the new face.

8. Seamless Clone (Blending)

    Use OpenCVâ€™s cv2.seamlessClone():

        Input the warped source face, target image, and mask.

        The function blends the faces smoothly so it looks natural (fixes lighting/edges automatically).

    The result is a new image where the source face is swapped onto the target face perfectly aligned.

9. Save and Display the Output

    Save the final swapped image using cv2.imwrite().

    Display it using cv2.imshow().

    Done! ðŸŽ¯

âš¡ Advantages of This Workflow:

    Pose Matching: Aligns source face pose to match the target.

    Smooth Blending: SeamlessClone hides lighting/color differences.

    Simple and Fast: Works even without training any models.

    Extendable: Easy to add enhancements like color correction or video swapping later.
